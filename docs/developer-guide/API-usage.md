# MapStore API usage
You can include MapStore in your application and interact with it via its [JavaScript API](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/docs/api/jsapi)

## How to use

1. Create a map using the standard installation
1. Go to Share -> Embed
1. Copy the API html code and paste it in your application page

The map will now load inside your application

    NOTE: If the map is using a Google Maps background you will have to provide your own API key.
    Add `&key=YOUR_API_KEY` in the <script> src value
