# How to release
Below you can find the release procedure as a checklist. On each release it can be updated (if needed), copied and pasted into a GitHub issue, of course changing the release name.
Then you can check each entry on the GitHub issue when done until the release is end.

## Release Checklist

- [ ] Create a branch (**YYYY.XX.00**)  
- [ ] Change [QA Jenkins job](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-QA-Build/) to build the new branch, enable the job continuous deploy
- [ ] Test on QA [http://qa.mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/](http://qa.mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/)  
    * Any fix must be done on both **YYYY.XX.00** and **master** branch  
    * Test **everything**, not only the new features
- [ ] Generate the changelog with github_changelog_generator
- [ ] Create a [github release](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/releases) pointing to the branch **YYYY.XX.00**.  
  > The Release name should follow be named YYYY.XX.mm where YYYY is the year, XX is the incremental number of the release for the current year (starting from 01) and the second number mm is an incremental value (starting from 00) to increment for minor releases.

  > from the job configuration page there is a link to access the job workspace to easily download the built WAR and binary package
- [ ] Write release notes with links to closed issues
- [ ] EITHER launch Jenkins job [MapStore2-Releaser](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/job/MapStore2-Releaser/) OR upload the war to stable  
- [ ] Close the related milestone
