# Developing with MapStore

Due to the dual nature of the project (Java backend and JavaScript frontend) building and developing using the MapStore 2 framework requires two distinct set of tools

* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for Java
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for JavaScript.

A basic knowledge of both tools is required.

# Developing and debugging the framework

To start developing the MapStore 2 framework you have to:

* download developer tools and frontend dependencies locally:

`npm install`

After a while (depending on the network bandwidth) the full set of dependencies and tools will be downloaded to the **node_modules** sub-folder.

* start a development instance of the framework and example applications:

`npm run examples`

* or you can start a development instance **without the examples**:

`npm start`

Then point your preferred browser to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).

The HomePage contains links to the available demo applications.

## Frontend debugging

The development instance uses file watching and live reload, so each time a MapStore 2 file is changed, the browser will reload the updated application.

Use your favourite editor / IDE to develop and debug on the browser as needed.

We suggest to use one of the following:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the following plugins:
  * editorconfig
    linter
    linter-eslint
    react
    lcovinfo
    minimap & minimap-highlight-selected
    highlight-line & highlight-selected
* [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with the following plugins:
    Babel
    Babel snippets
    Emmet

### Redux Dev Tools

When you are running the application locally using `npm start` you can debug the application with [redux dev tools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) using the flag ?debug=true

```
http://localhost:8081/?debug=true#/?_k=c51bb5
```

It also integrates with the [browser's extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension), if installed.

This way you can monitor the application's state evolution and the action triggered by your application.

## Back-end services debugging

By default `npm start` runs a dev server connected to the mapstore 2 online demo as back-end.

If you want to use your own local test back-end you have to:

1. run `mvn jetty:run` - it makes run the mapstore back-end locally (port 8080), Ã¬n memory db - By default 2 users
    * `admin` password `admin`
    * `user` with password `user`

2. Setup client to use the local back-end, apply this changes to `buildConfig.js` (at the devServer configuration)

    ```Javascript
    devServer: {
            proxy: {
                '/rest/': {
                    target: "http://localhost:8080"
                },
                '/proxy': {
                    target: "http://localhost:8080",
                    secure: false
                },
                '/docs': { // this can be used when you run npm run doctest
                    target: "http://localhost:8081",
                    pathRewrite: { '/docs': '/mapstore/docs' }
                }
            }
        },
        // ...
    ```

3. You have to run npm start to run mapstore client on port 8081, that is now connected to the local test back-end

You can even run geostore and http-proxy separately and debug them with your own IDE. See the documentation about them in their own repositories.

if you want to change the default port for mapstore back-end you have to edit `pom.xml` in the root of the project:

```xml
<!-- find the jetty-maven-plugin in pom.xml-->
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
    <artifactId>jetty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>9.2.11.v20150529</version>
    <configuration>
        <!-- add these lines -->
        <httpConnector>
            <port>9999</port> <!-- port 9999 or whatever you want -->
        </httpConnector>
        <!-- ^^ end of lines to add -->
        <systemProperties>
            <systemProperty>
                <name>log4j.configuration</name>
                <value>log4j-test.properties</value>
            </systemProperty>
        </systemProperties>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## Frontend testing

To run the MapStore 2 frontend test suite you can use:

`npm test`

You can also have a continuously running watching test runner, that will execute the complete suite each time a file is changed, launching:

`npm run continuoustest`

To run ESLint checks launch:

`npm run lint`

To run the same tests Travis will check (before a pull request):
`npm run travis`
