# How to release
Below you can find the release procedure as a checklist. On each release it can be updated (if needed), copied and pasted into a GitHub issue, of course changing the release name.
Then you can check each entry on the GitHub issue when done until the release is end.

## Changelog generation
Add an entry in the changelog like this:
```
## [2018.02.00](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/tree/v2018.02.00) (2018-09-11)

 - **[Full Changelog](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/compare/v2018.01.00...v2018.02.00)**

 - **[Implemented enhancements](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222018.02.00%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aenhancement)**

 - **[Fixed bugs](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222018.02.00%22+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug)**

 - **[Closed issues](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%222018.02.00%22+is%3Aclosed)**

```
Replacing:
 -  replacing `2018.02.00` with branch name
 - with current release tag name `v2018.02.00`
 - `%222018.02.00%22` with the name of the milestone (`%22` are `"` in the URL to generate a filter like `milestone:"2018.02.00"`)

## Release Checklist
```
- [ ] Create an issue with this checklist in the release milestone.
- [ ] If major release (YYYY.XX.00), create a branch `YYYY.XX.xx`  (`xx` is really `xx`, example: 2018.01.xx)
- [ ]  If major release,Change [QA Jenkins job](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-QA-Build/) to build the new branch, enable the job continuous deploy by updating the `branch` parameter in the build configuration page to `YYYY.XX.xx`
- [ ] Fix pom.xml to stable versions ( no -SNAPSHOT in relaase).
- [ ] create on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mapstore/) project the version build for `YYYY.XX.xx` (click on "Versions" and activate the version of the branch)
- [ ] Test on QA [http://qa.mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/](http://qa.mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/)
    * Any fix must be done on **YYYY.XX.mm**. The fixes will be manually merged on master
    * Test **everything**, not only the new features
- [ ] Test [Binary](https://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-QA-Build/ws/release/target/) (take the mapstore2-QA-<RELEASE_BRANCH>-bin.zip)
- [ ] Lunch the [stable deploy](https://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-Stable/) to install the latest stable version on official demo 
- [ ] remove manually from localConfig the entry for authentication to gs-stable in the deploied webapp.
- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md`. [Instructions](https://mapstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-guide/release/#changelog-generation)
- [ ] Commit the changelog to the release branch
- [ ] Create a [github draft release](https://github.com/geosolutions-it/MapStore2/releases) pointing to the branch **YYYY.XX.mm**.
  > The Release name should follow be named YYYY.XX.mm where YYYY is the year, XX is the incremental number of the release for the current year (starting from 01) and the second number mm is an incremental value (starting from 00) to increment for minor releases. Insert the tag vYYYY.XX.mm (**notice the initial 'v' for the tag**) and set the target branch as YYYY.XX.xx to create the tag when the release is published. In the release description describe the major changes and link the Changelog paragraph.
- [ ] Launch [MapStore2-Releaser](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/job/MapStore2-Releaser/) Jenkins job setting up the correct name of the version and the branch to build (**and wait the end**). **Note:** Using the MapStore2 Releaser allows to write the correct version number into the binary packages.
- [ ] Get the [latest mapstore.war](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-Releaser/ws/web/target/mapstore.war) from the Releaser Jenkins build and upload it to github
- [ ] Get the [latest mapstore2-YYYY.XX.mm-bin.zip](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-Releaser/ws/release/target/) from the Releaser Jenkins build and upload it to github
  > from the job [configuration page](http://build.geo-solutions.it/jenkins/view/MapStore2/job/MapStore2-Releaser/ws/) there is a link to access the job workspace to easily download the built WAR and binary package
- [ ] Check that the printing plugin is missing in the binary package to release
- [ ] Remove manually from localConfig the entry for authentication to gs-stable from binary and war packages.
- [ ] Upload the updated binary and war package
- [ ] Publish the release
- [ ] create on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/mapstore/) project the version build for `vYYYY.XX.mm` (click on "Versions" and activate the version of the tag, created when release was published)
