# MapStore vector style

The `vector` and `wfs` layer types are rendered by the client as GeoJSON features and it possible to apply specific symbolizer using the `style` property available in the layer options. The style object is composed by these properties

- `format` the format encoding used by style body
- `body` the actual style rules and symbolizers

example:

```json
{
  "type": "vector",
  "features": [],
  "style": {
    "format": "geostyler",
    "body": {
      "name": "My Style",
      "rules": [
        {
          "name": "My Rule",
          "symbolizers": [
            {
              "kind": "Line",
              "color": "#3075e9",
              "opacity": 1,
              "width": 2
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The default format used by MapStore is "geostyler" that is an encoding based on the [geostyler-style](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler-style) specification that could include some variations or limitations related to the map libraries used by MapStore app.
We suggest to refer to following doc for the rule/symbolizer properties available in MapStore.

Ths style `body` is composed by following properties:

- `name` style name
- `rules` list of rule object that describe the style

A `rule` object is composed by following properties:

- `name` rule name that could be used to generate a legend
- `filter` filter expression
- `symbolizers` list of symbolizer object that describe the rule (usually one per rule)

The `filter` expression define with features should be rendered with the symbolizers listed in the rule

example:

```js
// simple comparison condition structure
// [operator, property key, value]
{
  "filter": ["==", "count", 10]
}

// mulitple condition with logical operato
// [logical operator, [condition], [condition]]
{
  "filter": [
    "||",
    [">", "height", 10],
    ["==", "category", "building"]
  ]
}
```

Available logical operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `\|\|` | OR operator |
| `&&` | AND operator |

Available comparison operators:

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `==` | equal to |
| `*=` | like (for string type) |
| `!=` | is not |
| `<` | less than |
| `<=` | less and equal than |
| `>` | grater than |
| `>=` | grater and equal than |

The `symbolizer` could be of following `kinds`:

### Legacy Vector Style (deprecated)

The `style` or `styleName` properties of vector layers (wfs, vector...) allow to apply a style to the local data on the map.

- `style`: a style object/array. It can have different formats. In the simplest case it is an object that uses some leaflet-like style properties:
  - `weight`: width in pixel of the border / line.
  - `radius`: radius of the circle (valid only for Point types)
  - `opacity`: opacity of the border / line.
  - `color`: color of the border / line.
  - `fillOpacity`: opacity of the fill if any. (Polygons, Point)
  - `fillColor`: color of the fill, if any. (Polygons, Point)
- `styleName`: if set to `marker`, the `style` object will be ignored and it will use the default marker.

In case of `vector` layer, style can be added also to the specific features. Other ways of defining the style for a vector layer have to be documented.

### Advanced Vector Styles (deprecated)

To support advanced styles (like multiple rules, symbols, dashed lines, start point, end point) the style can be configured also in a different format, as an array of objects and you can define them feature by feature, adding a "style" property.

!!!warning
    This advanced style functionality has been implemented to support annotations, at the moment this kind of advanced style options is supported **only** as a property of the single feature object, not as global style.

### SVG Symbol (deprecated)

The following options are available for a SVG symbol.

- `symbolUrl`: a URL (also a data URL is ok) for the symbol to use (SVG format).
    You can anchor the symbol using:
  - `iconAnchor`: array of x,y position of the offset of the symbol from top left corner.
  - `anchorXUnits`, `anchorYUnits` unit of the `iconAnchor` (`fraction` or `pixels`).
  - `size`: the size in pixel of the square that contains the symbol to draw. The size is used to center and to cut the original svg, so it must fit the svg.
- `dashArray`: Array of line, space size, in pixels. ["6","6"] Will draw the border of the symbol dashed. It is applied also to a generic line or polygon geometry.

### Markers and glyphs (deprecated)

These are the available options for makers. These are specific of annotations for now, so allowed values have to be documented.

- `iconGlyph`: e.g. "shopping-cart"
- `iconShape`: e.g. "circle"
- `iconColor`: e.g. "red"
- `iconAnchor`: [0.5,0.5]

### Multiple rules and filtering (deprecated)

In order to support start point and end point symbols, you could find in the style these entries:

- `geometry`: "endPoint"|"startPoint", identify how to get the geometry from
- `filtering`: if true, the geometry filter is applied.

### Example (deprecated)

Here an example of a layer with:

- a point styled with SVG symbol,
- a polygon with dashed style
- a line with start-end point styles as markers with icons
