## What are actions?
Quoting the redux [documentation](https://redux.js.org/basics/actions) they are:
> Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your store.

They are simply plain JavaScript objects
```
/* trigger the panning action of the map to a center point */
const center = [42.3, 36.5];
export const PAN_TO = 'MAP:PAN_TO';
{
    type: PAN_TO,
    center
}
```
They must have type property, typically a constant with a string value, but any other properties are optional

## Why we use them
We need them to trigger changes to the application's store via reducers.
To do that we use Action Creators

## Action Creators
They are simply function that returns actions objects
```
const defaultValue = [42.3, 36.5];
/*
 * by convention, use an initial name (the action filename)
 * in order to describe better the action type, in this case MAP
 * separated by a colon : and the action constant name
*/
export const PAN_TO = 'MAP:PAN_TO';
export const panTo = (center = defaultValue) => ({
    type: PAN_TO,
    center
});
```
**Note:** Stick to es6 import/export module system and when possible provide a default value for the parameters

These action creators are used in the connected components or in [MapStore2 plugins](../plugins-howto/#connectedsamplejsx-2)
But actions by themselves are not enough we need Reducers that intercepts those actions and change the state accordingly.

**Note:** Remember to put all the actions .js files in the web/client/actions folder or in js/actions if you are working with custom plugins

## Reducers

Again quoting redux [documentation](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) they are:
> Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.

Reducers are pure functions that take the previous state and an action and return a new state
> (previousState, action) => newState

let's see an example:
```
// @mapstore is an alias for dir_name/web/client (see webpack.config.js)
import {PAN_TO} from '@mapstore/actions/map';

export default function map(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case PAN_TO: {
            return {
                ...state,
                center: action.center
            };
        }
        default: return state;
    }
}
```
As you can see we are changing the center of the map that triggers the panning action of the mapping library

And that's it we have wrote an action and a reducers that make the map panning around.

**Note:** Remember to put all the reducers .js files in the web/client/reducers folder or in js/reducers if you are working with custom plugins

## Advanced usage and tips
Sometimes you need to change a value of an item which is stored inside an array or in a nested object.

Let's imagine we have this object in the store:
```
layer: {
    features: [object_1, object_2, ...object_n]
}
```

And we have created an action that holds the id of the object to change and some properties
```
export const UPDATE_LAYER_FEATURE = 'LAYER:UPDATE_LAYER_FEATURE'
export const updateFeature = (id, props = {}) => ({type: UPDATE_LAYER_FEATURE, id, props})
```

Then in the reducer we can have different implementations.
Here we show the one using **arrayUpdate** from @mapstore/utils/ImmutableUtils for updating objects in array
```
import {UPDATE_LAYER_FEATURE} from '@mapstore/actions/layer';
import {find} from 'lodash';
const defaultState = {
    features: [{ id: 1, type: "Feature", geometry: { type : "Point", coordinates: [1, 2]}}]
};

export default function layer(state = defaultState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case UPDATE_LAYER_FEATURE: {
            // let's assume that action.props = {newProp: "newValue"}
            const feature = find(state.features, {id: action.id});
            // merging the old feature object with the new prop while replacing the existing element in the array
            const newFeature = {...feature, ...action.props};
            return arrayUpdate("features", newFeature, {id: action.id}, state);
            // after this you expect to find the new properties in the feature specified by the id
        }
        default: return state;
    }
}
```

# Testing
Tests in mapstore are stored in `__tests__` folder at the same level where actions/reducer are.
The file name is the same of the action/reducer with a '-test' suffix
```
actions/map.js
actions/__tests__/map-test.js
or
reducers/map.js
reducers/__tests__/map-test.js
```

We use [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) as testing library, therefore we suggest to have a look there.

## How to test an action
Typically you want to test the type and the params return from the action creator

let's test the mapTo action:
```
// copyright section
import expect from 'expect';
import {panTo, PAN_TO} from '@mapstore/actions/map';
describe('Test correctness of the map actions', () => {
    it('testing panTo', () => {
        const center = [2, 3];
        const returnValue = panTo(center);
        expect(returnValue.type).toEqual(PAN_TO);
        expect(returnValue.center).toEqual(center);
    });
});

```
In order to speed up the unit test runner, you can:
- change the path in tests.webpack.js (custom/standard project) or build\tests.webpack.js (framework) to point to the folder parent of __tests__
for example `'/js/actions'` for custom/standard project or `'../web/client/actions'` for framework

- then run this command:
`npm run continuoustest`

This allows to run only the tests contained to the specified path.
**Note:** When all tests are successfully passing remember to restore it to its original value.

## How to test a reducer
Here things can become more complicated depending on your reducer but in general you want to test all cases
```
// copyright section
import expect from 'expect';
import {panTo} from '@mapstore/actions/map';
import map from '@js/reducers/map'; // the one created before not the one present in @mapstore/reducers
describe('Test correctness of the map reducers', () => {
    it('testing PAN_TO', () => {
        const center = [2, 3];
        const state = map({}, panTo(center));

        // here you have to check that state has changed accordingly
        expect(state.center).toEqual(center);
    });
});
```

Here for speedup testing you can again modify the tests.webpack.js (custom/standard project) or build\tests.webpack.js (framework)
in order to point to the reducers folder and then running
`npm run continuoustest`

## Actions and epics
Actions are not only used by redux to update the store (through the reducers),
but also for triggering side effects workflows managed by epics
