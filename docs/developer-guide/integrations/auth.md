# MapStore Authentication - Implementation Details

In this section you can see the implementation details about the login / logout workflow implemented by MapStore.

### Configure session timeout

By default MapStore session token lives 24 hours and the refresh token last forever. On application reboot anyway all the tokens are cancelled. In order to change these default. the administrator can change these defaults by adding to `mapstore-ovr.properties` file the following properties: 

``` properties
    # Session timeout
    restSessionService.sessionTimeout=60 #in seconds
    restSessionService.autorefresh=false
```

- The `sessionTimeout` refers to session token expiration time (by default itâ€™s 24 hours)
- `autorefresh` refers to flag configured to handle automatic refresh process in the backend
  - when set to `false`, it avoids the use of refresh token after the session token has expired, meaning, after the timeout the user will have to reconnect
  - when set to `true`, the refresh token is used and the session extends everytime the session timeout is met

!!! note these configurations in `mapstore.properties` are valid for the default session storage. If you are using openID or keycloak, they will not be used.

Additionally, on the client side, in order to configure the interval in which is session `refresh` action is fired, one can use the `tokenRefreshInterval` property. It can be configued via `localConfig.json -> tokenRefreshInterval`, the value is in milliseconds.

```json
  tokenRefreshInterval: 60000 // default 30 seconds
```

When the above configured `Session timeout` is in place, the client can exhibit two behaviors based on the `tokenRefreshInterval` configured on the client side,

- when `tokenRefreshInterval` is **less than** `sessionTimeout` configured
  - when application is in use, the client tries to performs a refresh token call in the interval configured and session is prolonged
  - when the application is closed (i.e for any reason) and reopened after `sessionTimeout` configured, the client cannot perform refresh token call within the timeout window and hence the session expires and the user is asked to reconnect
- when `tokenRefreshInterval` is **greater than** `sessionTimeout` configured
  - the session expires and the client is unable to perform the refresh activity within the configured time interval. The user will have to re-authenticate
