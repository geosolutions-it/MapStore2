**[MapStore](http://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/)** is a framework to build _web mapping_ applications using standard mapping libraries, such as _OpenLayers 3_ and _Leaflet_.

MapStore  has several example applications:

 * **[MapViewer](http://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/)** is a simple viewer of preconfigured maps (optionally stored in a database using GeoStore)
 * **[Scalebar Example](http://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/examples/scalebar/)**
 * **[Layer Tree Example](http://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/examples/layertree/)**
 * **[Mouse Position Game](http://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/examples/mouseposition/)**
 * **MapPublisher TODO** has been developed to create, save and share in a simple and intuitive way maps and mashups created selecting contents by server like OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, MapQuest or specific servers provided by your organization or third party.

MapStore 2 is based on OpenLayers 3, Leaflet and ReactJS, and is licensed under the GPLv3 license.
