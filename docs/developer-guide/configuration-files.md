# Configuring MapStore

MapStore (and every application developed with MapStore) allows customization through configuration.
Several configuration files (at development and / or run time) are available to configure all the different aspects of an application.

 * [Application Configuration](../local-config)
 * [Maps configuration](../maps-configuration)
