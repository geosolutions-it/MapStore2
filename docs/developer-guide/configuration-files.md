# Configuring MapStore

MapStore (and every application developed with MapStore) allows customization through configuration.
Several configuration files (at development and / or run time) are available to configure all the different aspects of an application.

You can edit the application configuration by editing the **localConfig.json** file.<br>
See [Application Configuration](../local-config) for more info.

You can edit the configuration of a new map by editing the **new.json** file.<br>
See [Maps configuration](../maps-configuration) for more info.
