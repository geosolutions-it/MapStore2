## Configuring MapStore2

MapStore2 (and every application developed with MapStore2) allows customization through configuration.
Several configuration files (at development and / or run time) are available to configure all the different aspects of an application.

 * [Application Configuration](local-config)
 * [Maps configuration](maps-configuration)
