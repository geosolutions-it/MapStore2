# Street View
*******************

The **Street View** is an extension that can be included in the third step of the application context wizard to allow the end user to browse data from Google street view. The <img src="../img/button/street-view-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button, present in *Burger Menu* <img src="../img/button/burger.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" />, provides to the user the pop-up to navigate the map with Google street view.

Once the *Street View* pop-up opens, the streets on the map are highlighted and the user can select one on the map.

At this point the road is visible in the pop-up and the editor can:

* **Zoom in/out** <img src="../img/button/zoom-street.jpg"> on the street

<img src="../img/street-view/zoom-street.gif" class="ms-docimage"/>

* Use the **Pan Interaction** to navigate all-around the street

* Enable/disable the **Full Screen** <img src="../img/button/full-screen-street.jpg">
