# Street View

*******************

The **Street View** tool allows the user to browse [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/streetview/) contents in MapStore. Through the <img src="../img/button/street-view-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button available in the [Side Toolbar](mapstore-toolbars.md#side-toolbar), the tool can be activated so that it is possible to navigate the map with [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/streetview/).

When the tool is activated, a window opens and the streets highlighted on the map so that the user can select one of them with a simple click of the mouse.
