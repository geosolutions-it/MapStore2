# Exploring Dashboards

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/), a *Dashboard* is a space where the user can add many [Widgets](widgets.md#widgets), such as charts, maps, tables, texts and counters, and can create connections between them in order to:

1. Provide an overview to better visualize a specific data context

2. Interact spatially and analytically with the data by creating connections between widgets

3. Perform analysis on involved data/layers

In order to create a new dashboard, the user can click on the **Create Dashboard** from the *Add Resource** <img src="../img/button/add_resouces.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button in [Homepage](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/). With a click on it, an empty dashboard workspace appears. This page is composed of a [Top Toolbar](top-bar.md), a *Sidebar* and a *Viewer*:

## Side Toolbar

From the **Side Toolbar** the user can:

<img src="../img/exploring-dashboards/options-menu.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:150px;"/>

* [Add new widgets](adding-widgets.md#adding-widgets) with the <img src="../img/button/++++.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

* See the connections between widgets with the <img src="../img/button/show-connections.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button, available when connections are present (more information about this option are available in [Connecting Widgets](connecting-widgets.md#connecting-widgets) section)

* See the **About this dashboard** panel by clicking the <img src="../img/button/details2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button, when [Details](resources-properties.md#details) are present

* **Export** dashboard in `json` format by clicking the <img src="../img/button/export2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

* **Import** `json` dashboard files from your computer by clicking the <img src="../img/button/import2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button (it will replace the current dashboard directly)

* [Share](share.md) the dashboard by clicking the <img src="../img/button/share2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

* Start the **Tutorial** by clicking the <img src="../img/button/tutorial2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

## Viewer

Once the widgets are added in the viewer it is possible to:

* Change widgets position by moving them with a simple *Drag and Drop* and resize them:

<video class="ms-docimage" controls><source src="../img/exploring-dashboards/move-resize.mp4" /></video>

* Access widgets menu <img src="../img/button/menu.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> from which the user can choose between several options (more information about this menu's options can be found in Map's [Access Widget Menu](widgets.md#access-widgets-menu) section)

* Take a look at the widget *Description* (more information about widget *Description* can be found in Map's [Access Widgets Info](widgets.md#manage-existing-widgets) section)
