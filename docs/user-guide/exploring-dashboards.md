# Exploring Dashboards
**********************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), a *Dashboard* is a space where the user can add many [Widgets](widgets.md), such as charts, maps, tables, texts and counters, and can create connections between them in order to:

1. Provide an overview to better visualize a specific data context

2. Interact spatially and analytically with the data by creating connections between widgets

3. Perform analysis on involved data/layers

In order to create a new dashboard, the **New Dashboard** button <img src="../img/button/dash-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> appears in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) Homepage once logged as Administrator or Normal user. With a click on it, an empty dashboard workspace appears. This page is composed of a *Topbar*, a *Sidebar* and a *Viewer*:

## Topbar

Through the *Topbar* it is possible to:

* Access [GeoSolutions website](https://www.geo-solutions.it/) with a click on the <img src="../img/button/geosolutions-link.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> icon

* Set the language, with the *Language switcher*:

* Go back to the [Homepage](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) with the <img src="../img/button/home-page-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

* Take a look at the account info, change password and logout, with the <img src="../img/button/logged.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button (more info about these options are available in [Managing Users and Groups](managing-users-and-groups.md) section)

* Open the *Options* <img src="../img/button/burger.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> panel which allows you to start the *Tutorial* and [Save/Save as](resources-properties.md) the dashboard

## Sidebar

The *Sidebar* allows the user to:

* [Add new widgets](adding-widgets.md) with the <img src="../img/button/+++.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button

* See the connections between widgets with the <img src="../img/button/show-connections.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button, available when connections are present (more information about this option are available in [Connecting Widgets](connecting-widgets.md) section)

## Viewer

Once the widgets are added in the viewer it is possible to:

* Change widgets position by moving them with a simple *Drag and Drop* and resize them:
