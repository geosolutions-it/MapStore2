# Video Content Toolbar
**********************

As soon as a video content is added, the Video Content Toolbar appears on top of the video: 

<img src="../img/content-video-toolbar/c-video-toolbar.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Through this toolbar, the story editor is able to perform the following operation:

* **Change media source** <img src="../img/button/change-media2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to open the [Media Editor](media-editor-window.md) and change (or configure) the media content

* **Mute video** <img src="../img/button/mute-video-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to disable the video audio

* **Enable Autoplay** <img src="../img/button/autoplay-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to play the video automatically once the user is on it

* **Enable Loop** <img src="../img/button/loop-botton.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to continuously repeat the video

* **Hide caption** button <img src="../img/button/hide-caption.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to show/hide the description under the video: this button is present only if a description has been provided for the video resource (see the [Media Editor](media-editor-window.md) tool for example)

* **Remove** <img src="../img/button/remove2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the video content

!!! note
    Inside the Media Editor you can watch a preview of the video before adding it to the story. The video play will be available only in *View Mode* of the story: it is not available in edit mode except in the media editor as a preview.
