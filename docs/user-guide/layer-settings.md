The Identify button, located in the [Side bar](side-bar.md), is enabled by default and allows you to query objects on the map by clicking on it. You can choose to get the info in Plain Text, HTML, Properties List or to customize your own template. As an example:

* **Select** the HTML format, Then **Save** it.

<img src="img/html.png" style="max-width:350px;"/>

* **Click** on the layer. The info will be returned as a record (row) of a table corresponding to the info of that feature element of the layer.
