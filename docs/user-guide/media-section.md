# Media Section
**********************

Media Sections are similar to [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md) but the main difference is that as soon as the story editor try to add a new Media Section, the [Media Editor](media-editor-window.md) appears, asking to define the media that is going to be added. An example of a new Media Section with an image added can be like the following:

<img src="../img/media-section/media-s.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

Once the first media is added to the Media Section it is possible to add new media, text contents or web page contents or remove the existing ones as decribed also in the [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md).
