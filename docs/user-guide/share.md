# Sharing Resources
*******************

[MapStore]https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/)  provides the possibility to share resources (*maps*, *dashboards* and *geostories*) through two different ways:


* Directly from the MapStore [Homepage](home-page.md) by clicking on the Share button <img src="../img/button/share.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> present in the toolbar of each resource card

<img src="../img/share/share_cards.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

* Inside the resource by selecting the <img src="../img/button/share-button-bm.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-height:25px;"/> option from [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu)

From the *Share panel* the user is allowed to share a resource in different ways:

* With a **direct link**

* Through a **social network**

* With **embedded code** or **APIs** (only available for *maps*)

## Link

As soon as the *Share panel* opens, the **Link** section is the one visible by default:

<img src="../img/share/share_window.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

Here, the user can copy the resource **URL link** or share it through the **QR code**.

## Social

The **Social** section allows the user to share the resource on the most common social networks like **Facebook**, **Twitter** and **LinkedIn** simply by clicking on the social icon.

## Embed

The **Embed** section provides to the user the needed snippets, **embedded code** or the **MS APIs** (only available for *maps*) to embed MapStore in a third party web page.

In addition, [MapStore](mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) provides two options to customize a bit the *embedded code*:

* For maps, the user can choose to show the [TOC](toc.md) in the embedded map by enabling the **Shown TOC** option

* For dashboards, the user can show the [connections](connecting-widgets.md) between widgets on the embedded dashboard by enabling the **Show connections**

## Advanced options

Some **Advanced options** are available for maps and geostories inside the **Share** tool.

!!!note
    Some **Advanced options** are available only opening *Share tool* from the [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) and not from the MapStore home page.

### Advanced options for sharing maps

In case of maps, enabling the **Advanced options** in the *Share tool* the user can include the following to the share URL:

<img src="../img/share/share_window_map_options.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

* The **bounding box** parameter to share the current viewport of the map visualized by the user

* The desired center and zoom of the map by enabling the **Add center and zoom**

<img src="../img/share/share_window_center_zoom.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

The related available options allow the user to:

* Center the shared map to specific coordinates by typing them in two different formats (*Decimal* or *Aeronautical* that can be chosen through the <img src="../img/button/change-search-tool.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button) or by clicking on the map to set automatically the coordinate fields.

* Share the map at a specific **Zoom level** (`Min:1` and `Max:35`)

* **Add marker on loaded map** to show the center point in the shared map

### Advanced options for sharing GeoStories

In case of GeoStories, enabling the **Advanced options** in the *Share tool* the user can include the following to the share URL:

<img src="../img/exploring-stories/share_options.jpg" class="ms-docimage" width="400px"/>

* The **Home button** to allow the possibility to bring the user to the MapStore Home Page if needed: that button will be automatically included in view mode inside the story toolbar just beside the navigation bar.

* The **scroll position** allows to share the URL of the current section of the story visualized by the user
