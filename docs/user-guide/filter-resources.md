# Filter resources

***********

From the [Homepage](home-page.md#home-page), users can search for available resources in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) using the **Filter panel**, which opens on the left side of the homepage through the <img src="../img/button/filter_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> icon located to the right of the *Search tool*.

The Filter panel provides a variety of options to refine searches, which can be combined for more precise results. In particular, users can filter resources based on the following options:

* The **Search box** on the top of the panel: when the user trigger a search he is brought to the search page which shows you the search result through all resource types.

* The type of **Resources**: when the user enables/disables a resource type, he is directed to the search page that shows the selected resource type. Different types of resources can be: *My resources*, *Favorites*, *Maps*, *Dashboard*, *GeoStories* and *Contexts*.
