# Performing Measurements
*************************

Measure tools in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) allows the user to perform distance, area and bearing measurements on the map and to add the traced geometries as [Annotations](annotations.md).<br>
This tool is accessible from [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) by selecting the <img src="../img/button/measure-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-height:20px;"/> option that opens the following window:

<img src="../img/measure/measure.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:600px;"/>

Through this window it is possible to:

* Measure distance <img src="../img/button/measure-distance.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

* Measure Area <img src="../img/button/measure-area.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

* Measure Bearing <img src="../img/button/measure-bearing.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

* Add the measure as [Annotation](annotations.md) <img src="../img/button/add-as-annotation.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

## Measure distance

As soon as the measure window opens, by default the measure distance option is selected <img src="../img/button/measure-distance-green.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>. In order to perform a distance measure, each click on the map correspond to a vertex of the line (at least two vertices are needed) while the double click inserts the last vertex concluding the drawing session.

The available units of measure are:

## Measure area

Once the **Measure Area** button is selected <img src="../img/button/measure-area-green.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>, it is possible to start the drawing session (in this case at least 3 vertices need to be indicated). Same as measuring the distance, each click correspond to a vertex and the double click will indicate the last one.

In this case the available units of measure are:

## Measure bearing

Bearing measurements allows you to measure directions and angles. In the quadrant bearing system, the bearing of a line is measured as an angle from the reference meridian, either the north or the south, toward the east or the west. Bearings in the quadrant bearing system are written as a meridian, an angle and a direction. For example, a bearing of N 30 W defines an angle of 30 degrees west measured from north. A bearing of S 15 E defines an angle of 15 degrees east measured from the south.<br>
After selecting the **Measure Bearing** button <img src="../img/button/measure-bearing-green.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the user can draw a line with only two vertices that indicates respectively the starting and the ending point.

## Add measure as annotation

Once a measure is drawn, it gets possible to add it as [Annotation](annotations.md) through the <img src="../img/button/add-as-annotation.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button. The following panel opens:

<img src="../img/measure/add-as-annotation-ex.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

From this step the creation process is the same as that seen creating a normal annotation (see [Annotations section](annotations.md)).
