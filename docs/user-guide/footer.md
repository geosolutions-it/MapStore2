Located at the bottom of the Data Frame, the Footer can be expanded by clicking on the mouse icon <img src="../img/button/mouse-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> and it contains a scale bar, a map scale switcher, the coordinates of the mouse pointer and a coordinate reference system switcher.

CRS Selector
------------

[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) provides a *CRS Selector* through which you are able to switch the *Coordinate Reference System* of your map. In the bottom-right corner of the screen you should see this icon <img src="../img/button/crs_selector_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" />.

<img src="../img/footer/crs_selector.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:500px;"/>

Switching *CRS* is very simple:

* **Click** on the *CRS Selector* icon <img src="../img/button/crs_selector_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" />.

* **Select** the *CRS* and **click** on it.

In order to identify the desired CRS, you can also filter the CRS list by typing in a search input field located in the bottom part of the selector. This selection will be saved along with the map.

note: the list of CRSs is customizable by MapStore's configuiration.
