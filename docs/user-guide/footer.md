CRS Selector
------------

[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) provides a *CRS Selector* through which you are able to switch the *Coordinate Reference System* of your map. In the bottom-right corner of the screen you should see this icon <img src="../img/button/crs_selector_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" />.

<img src="../img/footer/crs_selector.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:500px;"/>

Switching *CRS* is very simple:

* **Click** on the *CRS Selector* icon <img src="../img/button/crs_selector_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" />.

* **Select** the *CRS* and **click** on it.

In order to identify the desired CRS, you can also filter the CRS list by typing in a search input field located in the bottom part of the selector. This selection will be saved along with the map.

!!! note
    The list of CRSs is customizable by MapStore's configuiration.
