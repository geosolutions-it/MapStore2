# Footer
********

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) some of the map information are reported in the *Footer*. By default, as soon as the user opens the map, the scale bar and the scale switcher are showed so that the user can change the scale bar by zooming in/out the map or by selecting a map scale through the scale switcher.

In order to visualize the map coordinates corresponding to the mouse pointer in the selected *Coordinate Reference System* of the map, the user can click on the button <img src="../img/button/mouse-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

## CRS Selector

 [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) allows also to change the *Coordinate Reference System* of the map by clicking on the **Select Projection** button <img src="../img/button/crs_selector_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>. A CRS selector opens to select one of the available CRSs, as follows:

!!! Note
    The list of available CRSs depends on the [CRS Selector configuration](https://mapstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer-guide/local-config/#crs-selector-configuration).

In order to search a desired CRS, the user can also filter the CRS list by typing in a search input field.
