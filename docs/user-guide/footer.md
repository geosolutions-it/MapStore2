CRS Selector
------------

[MapStore](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) provides a *CRS Selector* through which you are able to switch the *Coordinate Reference System* of your map. In the bottom-right corner of the screen you should see this icon <img src="../img/crs_selector_icon.png" style="max-width:30px;" />.

<img src="../img/crs_selector.png" style="max-width:500px;" />

Switching *CRS* is very simple:

* **Click** on the *CRS Selector* icon <img src="../img/crs_selector_icon.png" style="max-width:30px;" />.

* **Select** the *CRS* and **click** on it.

In order to identify the desired CRS, you can also filter the CRS list by typing in a search input field located in the bottom part of the selector. This selection will be saved along with the map.

note: the list of CRSs is customizable by MapStore's configuiration.
