<img src="../img/media-editor-window/current-story.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

!!! note
    By default a drop down list on the top right corner of the Media Editor allows to switch between maps currently used in the story (so the story editor can use again a map already present in the story if needed) and existing maps already available inside the MapStore catalog (that means that also classic maps created in MapStore can be used inside a Story).
