 
The Story Settings panel allows the editor to configure which additional components should appear to end users in the story view. The **Title**, a **Logo** and the **Navigation Toolbar**, if properly configured, will appear in the top bar of the story itself while the colors of the different components in the story can be customized in **Default Theme** and **Overlay** section of the story settings.

The Story settings panel is available in Edit Mode and it can be opened by clicking on the **Settings** button <img src="../img/button/setting-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.
