# Sidebar
*********

The *Sidebar* is a navigation panel containing various elements that help the user to explore the map. In particular, it is possible zooming, changing the extent, navigating in 3D mode and querying objects on the map. 
Moreover, the following icon <img src="../img/button/collapse.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> is used to expand/collapse the sidebar.

Geolocation tool
----------------

Through the *Show my position* <img src="../img/button/geolocation.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the user can center the map on his position. Therefore the button turns green. 

<img src="../img/side-bar/position.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

The position is still active even when the user interacts with the map; with a single click on the button it is possible re-center the map on his position. 
To disable the position the button needs to be duble clicked. 

Zooming tools
-------------

[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) provides several tools allows the user to:

* **Increase** the map zoom by using the zoom in icon <img src="../img/button/zoom-in.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> 

* **Decrease** the map zoom by using the zoom out icon <img src="../img/button/zoom-out.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

* **Switch to full screen**  <img src="../img/button/full-screen.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> view

* **Go back** <img src="../img/button/back-extent.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to the previous map extent in the map navigation history

* **Go forward** <img src="../img/button/forward-extent.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> to the next map extent in the map navigation history

* **Zoom to the maximum extent** <img src="../img/button/max-extent.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the map

3D Navigation
-------------
The *3D navigation* in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is based on CesiumJS. If the 3D button <img src="../img/button/3D-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> in the sidebar is clicked, the map switch in 3D mode so map contents are displayed on a 3D globe and it is possible to orbit around it through the compass place in the upper right corner of the map.

## Identify Tool

The *Identify* tool <img src="../img/button/identify.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> allows to retrieve information about layers on the map.
The tool is active by default (the button is green). Therefore if the user click on a layer in the map, the identify panel opens containing the layers information corresponding to the clicked point in the map (also the coordinates of the clicked point are reported in the identify panel).

<img src="../img/side-bar/identify-tool.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

The layers information are reported in plain text by default. It is possible to change the format by selecting the <img src="../img/button/setting_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> option in [Burger Menu](menu-bar.md#burger-menu) where the user can select, through the *Identify response format* menu, three different formats like: **TEXT**, **HTML** and **PROPERTIES**.

<img src="../img/side-bar/format-options.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:400px;"/>

The information will be returned in the format chosen by the user. For exaple with *PROPERTIES* format as follows:

<img src="../img/side-bar/format_example.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

!!! warning
    This global settings could be overwritten by a layer-specific configuration (see [Feature Info Form](layer-settings.md#feature-info-form)).


In addition to the layers information, the following are provided by the *Identify Tool*: 

* The **point address**  through the *More Info* button  <img src="../img/button/more_info_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>

<img src="../img/side-bar/more-info.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

* The **coordinates** <img src="../img/button/coordinates_editor_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> of the point

<img src="../img/side-bar/coordinate.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

!!! note
    The point coordinates are visualized in **decimal** or **areonautical** format. It is possible to change the format by the *setting* button <img src="../img/button/gear_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-heigth:50px;"/> 

* The **Highlight Features** button <img src="../img/button/highlight_features_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> allows to highlights on the map the layers features corresponding to the retrieved information in the clicked point.

### Using the Coordinates Editor

In order to Identify layers features by typing coordinates instead of clicking on the map, you can use the **Coordinate Editor**. 

The coordinates can be in **decimal** or **areonautical** format depending on the user needs. It is possible to change the format by the *setting* button <img src="../img/button/gear_icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton" style="max-heigth:50px;"/> 

An example of search with `Decimal` coordinates as follows:

<img src="../img/side-bar/decimal-ex.gif" class="ms-docimage"  />

An example of search with `Aeronautical` coordinates as follows:

<img src="../img/side-bar/areonautical-ex.gif" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:700px;"/>

### Identify Tool with more than one layer

On a map it is possible to have several overlapping layers. With the *Identify* tool the user can retrieve information on one or more overlapping layers at the same time.

If the user clicks on the map where one or more overlapping layers are present, the identify panel opens. The panel provides the layers information, therefore the user can navigate different layers information through the **Next** button <img src="../img/button/next.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> and **Previous** button <img src="../img/button/style_editor_back_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> present in the top right corner of the Identify panel.

<img src="../img/side-bar/layers.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

In order to have information about one layer only the user can select the layer on the [Table of Contents](toc.md), through the *TOC* button <img src="../img/button/show-layers.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>, and then click on the layer in the map to perform the identify operation only for that selected layer in TOC. The identify panel opens containing the layer information corresponding to the clicked point in the map, as follows:

<img src="../img/side-bar/layer.gif" class="ms-docimage"/>
