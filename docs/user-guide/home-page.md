# Home Page Overview
*******************

In order to get started, let us take a look at the portal interface and get an idea of how to navigate around it. Some functionalities are only restricted for
*Administrators* and will be pointed out once encountered. However, you will learn more about *Administrators*, *Users* and *Groups* [here](admin.md).

Once logged in as *Administrator*, the *Welcome Home Page* shows up as in the figure below and you will be able to view and make use of all the functionalities.
