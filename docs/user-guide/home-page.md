# Home Page Overview
*******************

In order to get started, let us take a look at the portal interface and get an idea of how to navigate around it. Some functionalities are only restricted for
*Administrators* and will be pointed out once encountered. However, you will learn more about *Administrators*, *Users* and *Groups* [here](managing-users-and-groups.md).

Once logged in as *Administrator*, the *Welcome Home Page* shows up as in the figure below and you will be able to view and make use of all the functionalities.

In this container the favorites maps and dashboards are stored and marked by a green star.
