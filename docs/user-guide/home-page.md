# Home Page

***********

In order to get started, let's take a look at the portal interface and get an idea of how to navigate around it. First of all it's necessary to specify that the user can take advantage of different tools and sections according to his authentication in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/). In particular, a user can access the [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) application by:

* Anonymous user

* Normal user

* Administrator user

## Anonymous user

Accessing [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) as anonymous user, the [Homepage](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) shows up as in the figure below:

<img src="../img/home-page/homepage-anonym.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

The anonymous user is allowed to:

* Access [GeoSolutions website](https://www.geosolutionsgroup.com/) through the <img src="../img/button/geosolutions-link.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> icon

* Open the **About** panel to know more information about [MapStore](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) and the deployed **Version** through the <img src="../img/button/about2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> icon

* Set the application language, with the *Language switcher*:

<img src="../img/home-page/language-switcher.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:150px;"/>

* Navigate through the **Featured** and **Contents** sections

* Change the way the resources on *Contents* section is displayed. Enable the list view of resources using the <img src="../img/button/list-view.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> or switch back to the card view of resources using the <img src="../img/button/card_view.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button.

<img src="../img/home-page/new-res.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:150px;"/>

* **Add/Remove to favorites** the resources through the <img src="../img/button/favorites_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button in the lower right corner of each resource.

Once logged in as *Administrator*, the [Homepage](https://mapstore.geosolutionsgroup.com/mapstore/#/) it's like the following:

<img src="../img/home-page/homepage-admin.jpg" class="ms-docimage" />

The admin can see and edit everything. In particular, in addition to what normal user can do, an administrator can also:

* [Manage Accounts](managing-users-and-groups.md#managing-users-and-groups) and [Manage tags](tags.md) through the drop-down menu of the <img src="../img/button/login-b.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button
