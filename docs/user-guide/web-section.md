# Web Page Section
**********************

Through this kind of sections the story editor can embed third party contents in the story (like other web pages available on the web). The Web Page Section is similar to the Paragraph Section and the Media Section: adding this section a modal window opens to specify the URL of the web page that is going to be added.

It is possible to add or remove multiple Web Page contents in the same way of text and media contents as it is explained in the [Paragraph Sections](paragraph-section.md).
