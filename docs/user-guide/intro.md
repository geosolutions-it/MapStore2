# MapStore 2

[MapStore 2](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is an **Open Source** highly modular webgis framework developed by [GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/) to create, manage and share securely in a simple and intuitive way maps and mashups created mixing contents served from servers like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, Bing or from server adehering to OGC standards like WFS, CSW, WMS, WMTS and TMS. It is installed and configured on a Web application server so multiple users can access the site using Web browsers. It is used to find, view, and query geospatial data published  and to integrate multiple sources into a single map view that can be easily navigated. Furthermore, with the release of the new version it allows the user to create dashboards for hosting widgets such as mini-maps, statistical charts, tables and much more. 

[MapStore 2](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) aims to be both a product as well as webgis framework. As a standard geoportal product, it is a web-based map visualization and analysis product that enables you to build a geospatial interactive web site or web service. It provides direct, real-time access to geospatial data warehouses of all the geospatial formats supported. And, it provides all of the spatial analysis functionality. This means that you can use it to build a web site that gives thin clients with nothing more than a web browser a powerful, dynamic, and open geospatial application previously available only in a desktop application. It is also a framework in the sense that it can be used as starting point to build sophisticated geospatial applications. It does not depend explicitly on any mapping engine but it can work with [OpenLayers 3](https://openlayers.org/) , [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) and [Cesium 3D viewer](https://cesiumjs.org/) ensuring the greatest flexibility when one wants to use it as a framework.

[MapStore 2](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) has been designed from the beginning to provide users with a coherent and comprehensive experience across different devices, hence it should automatically adapt to different screen size as shown below.
