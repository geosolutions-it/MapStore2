# Resource Properties
------------------------------

What a user can do, both on maps and dashboards, depends on its role.
<br>
**Admin** users can manage accounts and can *view* and *edit* all the maps and dashboards, whoever created them.
**Users** can view and edit only those maps and dashboards which they have created. If they are neither administrators nor owners, what they can do depends on the ***Rights*** assigned to the group they belong to.
<br>
The administrator can assign rights on maps to groups through the **Edit Map Properties** panel, accessible by this button <img src="../img/button/edit-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>:

<img src="../img/managing-user-rights/edit-map-properties-map.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

The panel looks like this:

<img src="../img/managing-user-rights/edit-map-properties-panel.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

In the **Add a rule...** section you can select a *Group* and assign a permission to it:

<img src="../img/managing-user-rights/select-rule-for-groups.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

In the example above the *can view* permission has been assigned to the *everyone* group. Clicking on the green plus **Add** button <img src="../img/button/add-rule-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the assignment will be saved and the rule added in the **Permission Groups** list:

<img src="../img/managing-user-rights/permission-rule-added.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

It is possible removing the rules from the list anytime by clicking the red **Remove** button <img src="../img/button/remove-rule-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.
<br>
The permission type, in the **Permission Groups** list, can be changed anytime from the select menu.
The available permissions have self-explained labels:

* **can view** allows group's members to view the map and to save a copy of it

* **can edit** allows group's members to edit the map and to save it
