# Resource Properties
------------------------------

What a user can do, both on maps and dashboards, depends on its role.

* **Admin** users can manage accounts and can *view* and *edit* all the maps and dashboards, whoever created them.

* **Users** can view and edit only those maps and dashboards which they have created. If they are neither administrators nor owners, what they can do depends on the *Rights* assigned to the group they belong to.

* **Everyone** can view or edit the maps and dashboard according to the *rights* that have been assigned by the administrator or their owners.

The administrator user can see, on the home page, the button **Edit properties** on the toolbar of each map card or dashboard card:

<img src="../img/managing-user-rights/edit-map-properties-map.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

By this button <img src="../img/button/edit-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> opens the **Edit Map Properties** through which you can:

* Add an image for the card **thumbnail** dropping or clicking inside the box:

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/edit-map-properties-panel_thumbnail.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:400px;"/>

    The image to be added must not be larger than 500 kb and its best dimensions are 300x180 pixel.

* **Add New Details** to describe the map (this tool is available only for maps):

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/edit-map-properties-panel_details.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

    Clicking on the button <img src="../img/button/add_details_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> opens a panel where you can write the details of the map and the [Text Editor Toolbar](text-editor-details.md) appears, allowing the user to edit his text:

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/details_panel.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

    Save the changes by clicking on the <img src="../img/button/save_large_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>. Three other buttons will appear on the panel **Edit properties**:
    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/new_button_details.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:400px;"/>
     
       * <img src="../img/button/details_preview_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> allows you to show the details preview
       * <img src="../img/button/edit-details-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> allows you to edit the details
       * <img src="../img/button/delete_white_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> allows you to delete the details sheet

    Now by clicking on save <img src="../img/button/save_large_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> you will return to the map card, where appears the **Show details** button <img src="../img/button/details_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/card-map-details-button.jpg" class="ms-docimage" style="max-width:400px;"/>

    Through this button the details can be viewed.The ability to display the *details* button will depend on which *rights* have been applied to the map by the administrator.

    <br>

* Assign *rights* on maps to groups, creating by the administrator as explained in [Managing Groups](managing-groups.md).

    In the **Add a rule...** section you can select a *Group* and assign a permission to it:

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/select-rule-for-groups.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/>

    In the example above the *can view* permission has been assigned to the *everyone* group. Clicking on the green plus **Add** button <img src="../img/button/add-rule-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> the assignment will be saved and the rule added in the **Permission Groups** list:

    <img src="../img/managing-user-rights/permission-rule-added.jpg" class="ms-docimage"  style="max-width:400px;"/> 

    It is possible removing the rules from the list anytime by clicking the red **Remove** button <img src="../img/button/remove-rule-icon.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.
    <br>
    The permission type, in the **Permission Groups** list, can be changed anytime from the select menu.
    <br>
    The available permissions have self-explained labels:

    * **can view** allows group's members to view the map and to save a copy of it

    * **can edit** allows group's members to edit the map and to save it
