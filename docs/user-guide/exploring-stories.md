# Exploring Story 
**********************

In [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), the Story is a tool that allows the user to express in a simple and dynamic way a concept combining and connecting text, maps, images, videos and other media as desired. The final result is an interactive flux of information customized according to user defined styles.

It is possible to approach a story in two different ways:

* Creating a new story or editing an existing one through the *Edit Mode*
* Present or simply enjoy a story and interact with it, through the *View Mode*

## Edit Mode

The *Edit Mode* allows the user to edit a story by adding, removing or modifying the elements inside it. This approach and its tools are used both to edit an existing story and to create a new one. <br>
In order to create a new story, the user can click on the **New Story** button <img src="../img/button/new_story_button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> on [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) homepage. As soon as you perform this operation the workflow appears in *Edit Mode* and composed of two main elements: the *Builder* and the *Sections Container* (later simply called *Container*).

The information flux of the Story is organized in Sections, that can be added from the <img src="../img/button/add-section.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> button on the bottom of the *Container*. In particular, the user can take advantage of four different types of sections:

* [Title Section](title-section.md)
* [Paragraph Section](paragraph-section.md)
* [Immersive Section](immersive-section.md)
* [Media Section](media-section.md)
* [Web Page Section](web-section.md)

## View Mode

The *View Mode* it's a way of approaching a story useful in cases where you would like to present the content of your work to someone, or simply every time you need to check up the progress of your project. <br>
The user can access the *View Mode* through the **Show preview** button <img src="../img/button/show-preview-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> in Builder's toolbar, and the first display is organized like the following:

<img src="../img/exploring-stories/view-mode-page.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

On the top of the page there is a **Top bar**, with the following tools, which allow the user to interact with the story:

<img src="../img/exploring-stories/top-bar.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

* **Edit Story** button <img src="../img/button/edit-icon-1.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> that allows to switching back to the *Edit Mode*
* **Navigation bar** allows to navigating to the different sections of the story 
* The **Title** the user choose for the story 
* The **Icon** of the story.  

!!! Warning
    For setting this information the user needed to go back on the *Edit Mode* and open the **Setting** button <img src="../img/button/setting-button.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/> just as explained in the [Story Setting](story-setting.md).

Most of the page is occupied by a large display space, that can be navigated through the **Navigation bar** or scrolling through the story. The user can interact with it browsing and zooming the maps, or observing full screen images and videos with just one click:

## Save a Story

If the story is not saved yet, there's only the possibility to perform the Save, but if a story was already saved it is possible to choose between Save and Save as.
