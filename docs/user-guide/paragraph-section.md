## Text

By default, as soon as you add a Paragraph Section, an empty text content is already inside it:

With a click on the text window, it is possible to write the text and customize it through the [Text Editor Toolbar](text-editor-toolbar.md). A possible result of adding and formatting the text can be the following: 

<img src="../img/paragraph-section/p-text-content.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>

The user can delete the text content with the Remove button  <img src="../img/button/remove2.jpg" class="ms-docbutton"/>.

## Media

Adding a media content, the [Media Editor Window](media-editor-window.md) opens, allowing the user to add an Image, a Video or a Map. 

### Images

An image added inside the paragraph section can be customized through the [Content Image Toolbar](content-image-toolbar.md). An example of an image with *medium size* and *left alignment* set, added just below a text content, can be the following:

<img src="../img/paragraph-section/parag-section.jpg" class="ms-docimage"/>
