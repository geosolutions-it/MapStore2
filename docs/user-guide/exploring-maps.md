In cartogrophy, a map is any two-dimensional graphic representation of the spatial relationships of the whole or a part of the earth. In digital cartography as in [MapStore 2](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), a map consists in overlaying various layers of geographic data and their styles in data frames, it contains various map elements such as a legend and a scale bar.

Let us discover the WebGIS portal interface and its main components by creating a simple map and adding a layer.  

From the *Home Page*, **Click** on the *New Map* icon <img src="img/new-map-icon.png" style="max-width:20px;" />. You will be addressed directly to the map viewer.

--------------------------------
To explain you better the map viewer, we have specially added a layer. You will learn more on layers in the [Table of Contents (TOC)](toc.md) and [Menu Bar](menu-bar) sections.

The portal interface of [MapStore 2](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/)  consists of the following blocks which will be often referred during the documentation. 

* <span style="color:red">Table of Contents (TOC)</span>, includes the map contents such as layer groups, layers and functions to manage the added layers. 

* <span style="color: green">Menu Bar</span>, includes a search bar, connections to the home page and account, and a list of options containing several functions.

* <span style="color:purple">Side Bar</span>, a navigation panel.

* <span style="color:gold">Basemap Switcher</span>, allows to change the world map in background.

* <span style="color:black">Footer</span>, includes a scale bar, coordinates and coordinate systems.

* <span style="color:blue">Data Frame</span>, where the layers are displayed.
