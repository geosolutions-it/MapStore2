In cartography, a map is any two-dimensional graphic representation of the spatial relationships of the whole or a part of the earth. In digital cartography as in [MapStore](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/), a map consists in overlaying various layers of geographic data and their styles in data frames, it contains various map elements such as a legend and a scale bar.

Let us discover the WebGIS portal interface and its main components by creating a simple map and adding a layer.

From the *Home Page*, **Click** on the *New Map* icon <img src="../img/new-map-icon.jpg" style="max-width:20px;" />. You will be addressed directly to the map viewer.

MapStore WebGIS Portal Interface
--------------------------------
To better explain the map viewer, we have specially added a layer. You will learn more on layers in the [Table of Contents (TOC)](toc.md) and [Menu Bar](menu-bar) sections.

The portal interface of [MapStore](https://mapstore2.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/)  consists of the following blocks which will be often referred during the documentation.

* The <span style="color:red">Table of Contents (TOC)</span> includes the map contents such as layer groups, layers and functions to manage the added layers.

* The <span style="color: green">Menu Bar</span> includes a search bar, connections to the home page and to the accounts page, a list of options containing several functions.

* The <span style="color:purple">Side Bar</span> is a navigation panel.

* The <span style="color:gold">Basemap Switcher</span> allows to change the world map in background.

* The <span style="color:black">Footer</span> includes a scale bar, the coordinates and the coordinates' systems.

* The <span style="color:blue">Data Frame</span> where the layers are displayed.
