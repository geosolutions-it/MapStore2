# MapStore
[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is an highly modular **Open Source** WebGIS framework developed by [GeoSolutions](https://www.geo-solutions.it/) to create, manage and securely 
share maps and mashups. This simple and intuitive framework is able to mix map contents provided by Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, 
Bing or other servers compliant to OGC standards like WFS, CSW, WMC, WMS, WMTS and TMS. 
[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is used to find, view and query published geospatial data and to integrate multiple remote sources into a single map; the result is
an high quality and user friendly framework that allows different kind of use cases by harmonizing remote data with smart and advanced 
functionalities (like chart widgets, dashboards, timelines and others).
[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) resources are not only related to Maps but also [Dashboards](https://mapstore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/exploring-dashboards/) and **Stories**; in [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) you can create your own innovative and fascinating 
**Application Context** where users can save, manage and share its own resources by also managing access permissions to other groups of users.

[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is not only a product but also a WebGIS framework. As a standard geoportal product, it is a web-based product that allows to provide  
a powerful and interactive geospatial WebGIS, it provides a direct and real-time access to geospatial data warehouses and it supports all available 
standards formats for geospatial data. 
[MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) also provides advanced spatial analysis capabilities that can be used to build WebGIS solutions through a powerful, dynamic and open 
geospatial application. Since [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is also a framework, you can use it to build your own WebGIS applications by using its plugins and modules.

Last but not the least, [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) is map agnostic and ensures the greatest flexibility: its abstraction tier allows to [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) to work with different web mapping libraries.
The supported mapping engines currently supported by [MapStore](https://mapstore.geo-solutions.it/mapstore/#/) are [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/) (used by default for desktops), [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) (used by default for mobile devices) and [Cesium 3D viewer](https://cesiumjs.org/).

MapStore has been designed from the beginning to provide a coherent and comprehensive experience across different devices types.

**MapStore  is based on OpenLayers, Leaflet and ReactJS, and is licensed under the Simplified BSD license.**
